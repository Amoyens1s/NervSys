## About Nervsys

* What is Nervsys?  
A very slight framework based on PHP7.2+ for universal API controlling.  

* Why called "Nervsys"?  
At the very beginning, as we hoped. The unit could process more like a nerve cell, and build together as a pure data-based calling system. Exact commands would be unnecessary to tell the system what to do.  

* Any short name?  
**NS**, that's what most of us call it. But, don't mix it up with Nintendo Switch.  

* Requirements:  
PHP **7.2+** and above. Any kind of web server or running under CLI mode.  

* Usage examples:  
    1. Ordinary framework for Web-developing
    2. API controller for all types of Apps
    3. Client for program communication
    4. More...
