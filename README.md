**NervSys** is a simple Neuron Model controller and Nervous System for data processing based on php7.

Requirements: PHP7.1+ and above. Any kind of web server or running under CLI mode. MySQL, Redis and redis extension for PHP depend on yourself.
 
Version 5.0.0 is on going, and not compatible with versions before.

Functional extensions (class) are considered to moved out to the third part to maintain.
 
Old version before 3.0.0 is discontinued and the source codes located here: https://github.com/Jerry-Shaw/NervSys/tree/3.2

Demo module is out and opened here https://github.com/Jerry-Shaw/demo. You can try it with NervSys with detailed comments in the scripts.

Just help us to push the project forward. Thanks!
